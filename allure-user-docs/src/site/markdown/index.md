# Introduction 

[Allure](http://allure.qatools.ru/) is an open-source framework designed to create test execution reports that are clear to everyone in the team. 
The Allure report is generated by [TAF Test Executor](https://taf.seli.wh.rnd.internal.ericsson.com/tedocs/latest/index.html) using Command Line Interface (CLI).

Allure Service is in-house online service with custom plugins based on [Allure](http://allure.qatools.ru/) tool usage which later replaces Allure CLI usage in multiple clients. 

The service is designed for flexible Allure report generation of test execution results and store temporarily report allowing to retrieve them later. 
As a result you also get a single Allure report from all your tests execution data, - right in your browser by URL.

All you need for Allure Service is your browser and some REST client tool like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) or any other.
